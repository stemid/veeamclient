# VeeamClient

Python API for connecting to Veeam Backup RESTful API service.

Very much an unfinished product right now, only finished as far as I needed it.

# Install

	$ python setup.py install

# Example

See the list\_job\_statistics.py file in tests/ that lists the current job statistics of all backup servers.

Also read the source, veeamclient.py is pretty self-explanatory for any python-coder.
